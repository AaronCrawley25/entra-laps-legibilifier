# entra-laps-legibilifier

A *very* minimal Chrome/Edge extension to make LAPS passwords actually readable
  in the Entra console

This is purposfully a minimum viable product with no other use to be as transparent
  as possible when running in important and confidential environments. You can
  and should read through **ALL** of the repo in ~30 seconds.
